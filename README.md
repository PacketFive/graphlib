# Graph Library

A Python library for graph manipulation and algorithms, including OSPF and Dijkstra's.

## Features

- Graph data structure allowing storage of arbitrary objects.
- Implementation of common graph algorithms.
- OSPF-related functionalities.
- Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.
- Comprehensive unit tests.
- Pip installable package.

## Installation

```bash
# Coming soon! You'll be able to install with pip:
# pip install graph-lib
```

## Usage

```python
# Example usage (to be developed)
# from graph_lib import Graph

# g = Graph()
# g.add_node("A", data={"value": 10})
# g.add_node("B")
# g.add_edge("A", "B", weight=5)

# print(g.get_node_data("A"))
# print(list(g.neighbors("A")))
```
